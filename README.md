# Lithic Python API library

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lithic.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lithic/)

The Lithic Python library provides convenient access to the Lithic REST API from any Python 3.7+
application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

## Documentation

The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.lithic.com).

## Installation

```sh
pip install lithic
```

## Usage

The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](https://www.github.com/lithic-com/lithic-python/blob/main/api.md).

```python
import os
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("LITHIC_API_KEY"),
    # defaults to "production".
    environment="sandbox",
)

card = client.cards.create(
    type="SINGLE_USE",
)
print(card.token)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument,
we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
to add `LITHIC_API_KEY="My Lithic API Key"` to your `.env` file
so that your API Key is not stored in source control.

## Async usage

Simply import `AsyncLithic` instead of `Lithic` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from lithic import AsyncLithic

client = AsyncLithic(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("LITHIC_API_KEY"),
    # defaults to "production".
    environment="sandbox",
)


async def main() -> None:
    card = await client.cards.create(
        type="SINGLE_USE",
    )
    print(card.token)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

## Using types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). Responses are [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev), which provide helper methods for things like:

- Serializing back into JSON, `model.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_unset=True)`
- Converting to a dictionary, `model.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`

Typed requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `basic`.

## Pagination

List methods in the Lithic API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```python
import lithic

client = Lithic()

all_cards = []
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for card in client.cards.list():
    # Do something with card here
    all_cards.append(card)
print(all_cards)
```

Or, asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
import lithic

client = AsyncLithic()


async def main() -> None:
    all_cards = []
    # Iterate through items across all pages, issuing requests as needed.
    async for card in client.cards.list():
        all_cards.append(card)
    print(all_cards)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Alternatively, you can use the `.has_next_page()`, `.next_page_info()`, or `.get_next_page()` methods for more granular control working with pages:

```python
first_page = await client.cards.list()
if first_page.has_next_page():
    print(f"will fetch next page using these details: {first_page.next_page_info()}")
    next_page = await first_page.get_next_page()
    print(f"number of items we just fetched: {len(next_page.data)}")

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

Or just work directly with the returned data:

```python
first_page = await client.cards.list()

print(f"next page cursor: {first_page.starting_after}")  # => "next page cursor: ..."
for card in first_page.data:
    print(card.token)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

## Nested params

Nested parameters are dictionaries, typed using `TypedDict`, for example:

```python
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic()

card = client.cards.create(
    type="VIRTUAL",
)
print(card.token)
```

## Webhook Verification

We provide helper methods for verifying that a webhook request came from Lithic, and not a malicious third party.

You can use `lithic.webhooks.verify_signature(body: string, headers, secret?) -> None` or `lithic.webhooks.unwrap(body: string, headers, secret?) -> Payload`,
both of which will raise an error if the signature is invalid.

Note that the "body" parameter must be the raw JSON string sent from the server (do not parse it first).
The `.unwrap()` method can parse this JSON for you into a `Payload` object.

For example, in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):

```py
@app.post('/my-webhook-handler')
async def handler(request: Request):
    body = await request.body()
    secret = os.environ['LITHIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET']  # env var used by default; explicit here.
    payload = client.webhooks.unwrap(body, request.headers, secret)
    print(payload)

    return {'ok': True}
```

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API (for example, due to network connection problems or a timeout), a subclass of `lithic.APIConnectionError` is raised.

When the API returns a non-success status code (that is, 4xx or 5xx
response), a subclass of `lithic.APIStatusError` is raised, containing `status_code` and `response` properties.

All errors inherit from `lithic.APIError`.

```python
import lithic
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic()

try:
    client.cards.create(
        type="an_incorrect_type",
    )
except lithic.APIConnectionError as e:
    print("The server could not be reached")
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except lithic.RateLimitError as e:
    print("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
except lithic.APIStatusError as e:
    print("Another non-200-range status code was received")
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable retry settings:

```python
from lithic import Lithic

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = Lithic(
    # default is 2
    max_retries=0,
)

# Or, configure per-request:
client.with_options(max_retries=5).cards.list(
    page_size=10,
)
```

### Timeouts

By default requests time out after 1 minute. You can configure this with a `timeout` option,
which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#fine-tuning-the-configuration) object:

```python
from lithic import Lithic

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = Lithic(
    # 20 seconds (default is 1 minute)
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
client = Lithic(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
client.with_options(timeout=5 * 1000).cards.list(
    page_size=10,
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Default Headers

We automatically send the `X-Lithic-Pagination` header set to `cursor`.

If you need to, you can override it by setting default headers per-request or on the client object.

```python
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic(
    default_headers={"X-Lithic-Pagination": "My-Custom-Value"},
)
```

## Advanced

### Logging

We use the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.

You can enable logging by setting the environment variable `LITHIC_LOG` to `debug`.

```shell
$ export LITHIC_LOG=debug
```

### How to tell whether `None` means `null` or missing

In an API response, a field may be explicitly `null`, or missing entirely; in either case, its value is `None` in this library. You can differentiate the two cases with `.model_fields_set`:

```py
if response.my_field is None:
  if 'my_field' not in response.model_fields_set:
    print('Got json like {}, without a "my_field" key present at all.')
  else:
    print('Got json like {"my_field": null}.')
```

### Accessing raw response data (e.g. headers)

The "raw" Response object can be accessed by prefixing `.with_raw_response.` to any HTTP method call.

```py
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic()
response = client.cards.with_raw_response.create(
    type="SINGLE_USE",
)
print(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'))

card = response.parse()  # get the object that `cards.create()` would have returned
print(card.token)
```

These methods return an [`APIResponse`](https://github.com/lithic-com/lithic-python/tree/main/src/lithic/_response.py) object.

### Configuring the HTTP client

You can directly override the [httpx client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) to customize it for your use case, including:

- Support for proxies
- Custom transports
- Additional [advanced](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#client-instances) functionality

```python
import httpx
from lithic import Lithic

client = Lithic(
    # Or use the `LITHIC_BASE_URL` env var
    base_url="http://my.test.server.example.com:8083",
    http_client=httpx.Client(
        proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```

### Managing HTTP resources

By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is [garbage collected](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__). You can manually close the client using the `.close()` method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting.

## Versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/lithic-com/lithic-python/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

## Requirements

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lithic.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lithic/)

The Lithic Python library provides convenient access to the Lithic REST API from any Python 3.7+
application. It includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

## Documentation

The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.lithic.com).

## Installation

```sh
pip install lithic
```

## Usage

```python
from lithic import Lithic

lithic = Lithic(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("LITHIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my api key",
    # defaults to "production".
    environment="sandbox",
)

card = lithic.cards.create(
    type="SINGLE_USE",
)
print(card.token)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument, we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
and adding `LITHIC_API_KEY="my api key"` to your `.env` file so that your API Key is not stored in source control.

## Async Usage

Simply import `AsyncLithic` instead of `Lithic` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
from lithic import AsyncLithic

lithic = AsyncLithic(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("LITHIC_API_KEY")
    api_key="my api key",
    # defaults to "production".
    environment="sandbox",
)


async def main():
    card = await lithic.cards.create(
        type="SINGLE_USE",
    )
    print(card.token)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

## Using Types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict), while responses are [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) models. This helps provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor.

If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `"basic"`.

## Pagination

List methods in the Lithic API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```python
import lithic

lithic = Lithic()

all_cards = []
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for card in lithic.cards.list():
    # Do something with card here
    all_cards.append(card)
print(all_cards)
```

Or, asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
import lithic

lithic = AsyncLithic()


async def main() -> None:
    all_cards = []
    # Iterate through items across all pages, issuing requests as needed.
    async for card in lithic.cards.list():
        all_cards.append(card)
    print(all_cards)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Alternatively, you can use the `.has_next_page()`, `.next_page_info()`, or `.get_next_page()` methods for more granular control working with pages:

```python
first_page = await lithic.cards.list()
if first_page.has_next_page():
    print(f"will fetch next page using these details: {first_page.next_page_info()}")
    next_page = await first_page.get_next_page()
    print(f"number of items we just fetched: {len(next_page.data)}")

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

Or just work directly with the returned data:

```python
first_page = await lithic.cards.list()

print(f"page number: {first_page.page}")  # => "page number: 1"
for card in first_page.data:
    print(card.token)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

## Nested params

Nested parameters are dictionaries, typed using `TypedDict`, for example:

```python
from lithic import Lithic

lithic = Lithic()

lithic.cards.create(
    foo={
        "bar": True,
    },
)
```

## Webhook Verification

We provide helper methods for verifying that a webhook request came from Lithic, and not a malicious third party.

You can use `lithic.webhooks.verify_signature(body: string, headers, secret?) -> None` or `lithic.webhooks.unwrap(body: string, headers, secret?) -> Payload`,
both of which will raise an error if the signature is invalid.

Note that the "body" parameter must be the raw JSON string sent from the server (do not parse it first).
The `.unwrap()` method can parse this JSON for you into a `Payload` object.

For example, in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):

```py
@app.post('/my-webhook-handler')
async def handler(request: Request):
    body = await request.body()
    secret = os.environ['LITHIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET']  # env var used by default; explicit here.
    payload = client.webhooks.unwrap(body, request.headers, secret)
    print(payload)

    return {'ok': True}
```

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API (e.g., due to network connection problems or a timeout), a subclass of `lithic.APIConnectionError` is raised.

When the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx
response), a subclass of `lithic.APIStatusError` will be raised, containing `status_code` and `response` properties.

All errors inherit from `lithic.APIError`.

```python
from lithic import Lithic

lithic = Lithic()

try:
    lithic.cards.create(
        type="an_incorrect_type",
    )
except lithic.APIConnectionError as e:
    print("The server could not be reached")
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except lithic.RateLimitError as e:
    print("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
except lithic.APIStatusError as e:
    print("Another non-200-range status code was received")
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,
and >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable this:

```python
from lithic import Lithic

# Configure the default for all requests:
lithic = Lithic(
    # default is 2
    max_retries=0,
)

# Or, configure per-request:
lithic.with_options(max_retries=5).cards.list(
    page_size=10,
)
```

### Timeouts

Requests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option,
which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#fine-tuning-the-configuration):

```python
from lithic import Lithic

# Configure the default for all requests:
lithic = Lithic(
    # default is 60s
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
lithic = Lithic(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
lithic.with_options(timeout=5 * 1000).cards.list(
    page_size=10,
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced: Configuring custom URLs, proxies, and transports

You can configure the following keyword arguments when instantiating the client:

```python
import httpx
from lithic import Lithic

lithic = Lithic(
    # Use a custom base URL
    base_url="http://my.test.server.example.com:8083",
    proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
    transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
)
```

See the httpx documentation for information about the [`proxies`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#http-proxying) and [`transport`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#custom-transports) keyword arguments.

# Migration guide

This section outlines the features that were deprecated in `v0.5.0`, and subsequently removed in `v0.6.0` and how to migrate your code.

## Breaking changes

### TypedDict â†’ keyword arguments

The way you pass arguments to methods has been changed from a single `TypedDict` to individual arguments. For example, this snippet:

```python
card = await client.cards.create({"type": "VIRTUAL"})
```

Now becomes:

```python
card = await client.cards.create(type="VIRTUAL")
```

#### Migrating

The easiest way to make your code compatible with this change is to add `**{`, for example:

```diff
- card = await client.cards.create({'type': 'VIRTUAL'})
+ card = await client.cards.create(**{'type': 'VIRTUAL'})
```

However, it is highly recommended to completely switch to explicit keyword arguments:

```diff
- card = await client.cards.create({'type': 'VIRTUAL'})
+ card = await client.cards.create(type='VIRTUAL')
```

### Named path arguments

All but the last path parameter must now be passed as named arguments instead of positional arguments, for example, for a method that calls the endpoint `/account_holders/{account_holder_token}/documents/{document_token}` you would've been able to call the method like this:

```python
card = await client.account_holders.retrieve(
    "account_holder_token", "my_document_token"
)
```

But now you must call the method like this:

```python
card = await client.account_holders.retrieve(
    "my_document_token", account_holder_token="account_holder_token"
)
```

If you have type checking enabled in your IDE it will tell you which parts of your code need to be updated.

### Request options

You used to be able to set request options on a per-method basis, now you can only set them on the client. There are two methods that you can use to make this easy, `with_options` and `copy`.

If you need to make multiple requests with changed options, you can use `.copy()` to get a new client object with those options. This can be useful if you need to set a custom header for multiple requests, for example:

```python
copied = client.copy(default_headers={"X-My-Header": "Foo"})
card = await copied.cards.create(type="VIRTUAL")
await copied.cards.provision(card.token, digital_wallet="GOOGLE_PAY")
```

If you just need to override one of the client options for one request, you can use `.with_options()`, for example:

```python
await client.with_options(timeout=None).cards.create(type="VIRTUAL")
```

It should be noted that the `.with_options()` method is simply an alias to `.copy()`, you can use them interchangeably.

You can pass nearly every argument that is supported by the Client `__init__` method to the `.copy()` method, except for `proxies` and `transport`.

```python
copied = client.copy(
    api_key="...",
    environment="sandbox",
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(read=10),
    max_retries=5,
    default_headers={
        "X-My-Header": "value",
    },
    default_query={
        "my_default_param": "value",
    },
)
```

## New features

### Pass custom headers

If you need to add additional headers to a request you can easily do so with the `extra_headers` argument:

```python
card = await client.cards.create(
    type="VIRTUAL",
    extra_headers={
        "X-Foo": "my header",
    },
)
```

### Pass custom JSON properties

You can add additional properties to the JSON request body that are not included directly in the method definition through the `extra_body` argument. This can be useful when there are in new properties in the API that are in beta and aren't in the SDK yet.

```python
card = await client.cards.create(
    type="VIRTUAL",
    extra_body={
        "special_prop": "foo",
    },
)
# sends this to the API:
# {"type": "VIRTUAL", "special_prop": "foo"}
```

### Pass custom query parameters

You can add additional query parameters that aren't specified in the method definition through the `extra_query` argument. This can be useful when there are any new/beta query parameters that are not yet in the SDK.

```python
card = await client.cards.create(
    type="VIRTUAL",
    extra_query={
        "special_param": "bar",
    },
)
# makes the request to this URL:
# https://api.lithic.com/v1/cards?special_param=bar
```

## Rich `date` and `datetime` types

We've improved the types for response fields / request params that correspond to `date` or `datetime` values!

Previously they were just raw strings but now response fields will be instances of `date` or `datetime`.

This means that if you're working with these fields and parsing them into `datetime` instances manually you will have to remove
any code that performs said parsing.

```diff
card = client.cards.retrieve('<token>')
- created = datetime.fromisoformat(card.created_at)
+ created = card.created_at
print(created.month)
```

For request params you can continue to pass in strings if you want to use a datetime library other than the standard library version but if you
were writing code that looked like this:

```py
dt = datetime(...)
for card in client.cards.list(begin=dt.isoformat()):
  ...
```

You can remove the explicit call to `isoformat`!

```diff
dt = datetime(...)
- for card in client.cards.list(begin=dt.isoformat()):
+ for card in client.cards.list(begin=dt):
  ...
```

## Status

This package is in beta. Its internals and interfaces are not stable and subject to change without a major semver bump;
please reach out if you rely on any undocumented behavior.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/lithic-com/lithic-python/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

## Requirements

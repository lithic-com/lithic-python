        Initiates a request to asynchronously generate a backtest for an authorization
        rule. During backtesting, both the active version (if one exists) and the draft
        version of the Authorization Rule are evaluated by replaying historical
        transaction data against the rule's conditions. This process allows customers to
        simulate and understand the effects of proposed rule changes before deployment.
        The generated backtest report provides detailed results showing whether the
        draft version of the Auth Rule would have approved or declined historical
        transactions which were processed during the backtest period. These reports help
        evaluate how changes to rule configurations might affect overall transaction
        approval rates.

        The generated backtest report will be delivered asynchronously through a webhook
        with `event_type` = `auth_rules.backtest_report.created`. See the docs on
        setting up [webhook subscriptions](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/events-api). It
        is also possible to request backtest reports on-demand through the

        endpoint.

        Lithic currently supports backtesting for `CONDITIONAL_BLOCK` rules. Backtesting
        for `VELOCITY_LIMIT` rules is generally not supported. In specific cases (i.e.
        where Lithic has pre-calculated the requested velocity metrics for historical
        transactions), a backtest may be feasible. However, such cases are uncommon and
        customers should not anticipate support for velocity backtests under most
        configurations. If a historical transaction does not feature the required inputs
        to evaluate the rule, then it will not be included in the final backtest report.

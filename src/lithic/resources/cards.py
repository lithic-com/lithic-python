        """Create a new virtual or physical card.

        Parameters `pin`, `shipping_address`, and
        `product_id` only apply to physical cards.

        Args:
          type:
              Card types:

              - `VIRTUAL` - Card will authorize at any merchant and can be added to a digital
                wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay (if the card program is digital
                wallet-enabled).
              - `PHYSICAL` - Manufactured and sent to the cardholder. We offer white label
                branding, credit, ATM, PIN debit, chip/EMV, NFC and magstripe functionality.
                Reach out at [lithic.com/contact](https://lithic.com/contact) for more
                information.
              - `SINGLE_USE` - Card is closed upon first successful authorization.
              - `MERCHANT_LOCKED` - _[Deprecated]_ Card is locked to the first merchant that
                successfully authorizes the card.

          account_token: Globally unique identifier for the account that the card will be associated
              with. Required for programs enrolling users using the
              [/account_holders endpoint](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/account-holders-kyc).
              See [Managing Your Program](doc:managing-your-program) for more information.

          card_program_token: For card programs with more than one BIN range. This must be configured with
              Lithic before use. Identifies the card program/BIN range under which to create
              the card. If omitted, will utilize the program's default `card_program_token`.
              In Sandbox, use 00000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000 and
              00000000-0000-0000-2000-000000000000 to test creating cards on specific card
              programs.

          digital_card_art_token: Specifies the digital card art to be displayed in the userâ€™s digital wallet
              after tokenization. This artwork must be approved by Mastercard and configured
              by Lithic to use. See
              [Flexible Card Art Guide](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/about-digital-wallets#flexible-card-art).

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card. We recommend against using this field to
              store JSON data as it can cause unexpected behavior.

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Only applicable to cards of type `PHYSICAL`. This must be configured with Lithic
              before use. Specifies the configuration (i.e., physical card art) that the card
              should be manufactured with.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL. Use of
              options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined. Note that a spend limit of 0 is effectively no
              limit, and should only be used to reset or remove a prior limit. Only a limit of
              1 or above will result in declined transactions due to checks against the card
              limit.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorize multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.

        Handling full card PANs and CVV codes requires that you comply with the Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Some clients choose to reduce
        their compliance obligations by leveraging our embedded card UI solution
        documented below.

        In this setup, PANs and CVV codes are presented to the end-user via a card UI
        that we provide, optionally styled in the customer's branding using a specified
        css stylesheet. A user's browser makes the request directly to api.lithic.com,
        so card PANs and CVVs never touch the API customer's servers while full card
        data is displayed to their end-users. The response contains an HTML document.
        This means that the url for the request can be inserted straight into the `src`
        attribute of an iframe.

        ```html
        <iframe
          id="card-iframe"
          src="https://sandbox.lithic.com/v1/embed/card?embed_request=eyJjc3MiO...;hmac=r8tx1..."
          allow="clipboard-write"
          class="content"
        ></iframe>
        ```

        You should compute the request payload on the server side. You can render it (or
        the whole iframe) on the server or make an ajax call from your front end code,
        but **do not ever embed your API key into front end code, as doing so introduces
        a serious security vulnerability**.

        Handling full card PANs and CVV codes requires that you comply with the Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Some clients choose to reduce
        their compliance obligations by leveraging our embedded card UI solution
        documented below.

        In this setup, PANs and CVV codes are presented to the end-user via a card UI
        that we provide, optionally styled in the customer's branding using a specified
        css stylesheet. A user's browser makes the request directly to api.lithic.com,
        so card PANs and CVVs never touch the API customer's servers while full card
        data is displayed to their end-users. The response contains an HTML document.
        This means that the url for the request can be inserted straight into the `src`
        attribute of an iframe.

        ```html
        <iframe
          id="card-iframe"

          allow="clipboard-write"
          class="content"
        ></iframe>
        ```

        You should compute the request payload on the server side. You can render it (or
        the whole iframe) on the server or make an ajax call from your front end code,
        but **do not ever embed your API key into front end code, as doing so introduces
        a serious security vulnerability**.

              Card types:

              - `VIRTUAL` - Card will authorize at any merchant and can be added to a digital
                wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay (if the card program is digital
                wallet-enabled).
              - `PHYSICAL` - Manufactured and sent to the cardholder. We offer white label
                branding, credit, ATM, PIN debit, chip/EMV, NFC and magstripe functionality.
                Reach out at [lithic.com/contact](https://lithic.com/contact) for more
                information.
              - `SINGLE_USE` - Card is closed upon first successful authorization.
              - `MERCHANT_LOCKED` - _[Deprecated]_ Card is locked to the first merchant that
                successfully authorizes the card.

          account_token: Globally unique identifier for the account that the card will be associated
              with. Required for programs enrolling users using the
              [/account_holders endpoint](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/account-holders-kyc).
              See [Managing Your Program](doc:managing-your-program) for more information.

          card_program_token: For card programs with more than one BIN range. This must be configured with
              Lithic before use. Identifies the card program/BIN range under which to create
              the card. If omitted, will utilize the program's default `card_program_token`.
              In Sandbox, use 00000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000 and
              00000000-0000-0000-2000-000000000000 to test creating cards on specific card
              programs.

          digital_card_art_token: Specifies the digital card art to be displayed in the userâ€™s digital wallet
              after tokenization. This artwork must be approved by Mastercard and configured
              by Lithic to use. See
              [Flexible Card Art Guide](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/about-digital-wallets#flexible-card-art).

          exp_month: Two digit (MM) expiry month. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is provided,
              an expiration date will be generated.

          exp_year: Four digit (yyyy) expiry year. If neither `exp_month` nor `exp_year` is
              provided, an expiration date will be generated.

          memo: Friendly name to identify the card. We recommend against using this field to
              store JSON data as it can cause unexpected behavior.

          pin: Encrypted PIN block (in base64). Only applies to cards of type `PHYSICAL` and
              `VIRTUAL`. See
              [Encrypted PIN Block](https://docs.lithic.com/docs/cards#encrypted-pin-block-enterprise).

          product_id: Only applicable to cards of type `PHYSICAL`. This must be configured with Lithic
              before use. Specifies the configuration (i.e., physical card art) that the card
              should be manufactured with.

          shipping_method: Shipping method for the card. Only applies to cards of type PHYSICAL. Use of
              options besides `STANDARD` require additional permissions.

              - `STANDARD` - USPS regular mail or similar international option, with no
                tracking
              - `STANDARD_WITH_TRACKING` - USPS regular mail or similar international option,
                with tracking
              - `EXPEDITED` - FedEx Standard Overnight or similar international option, with
                tracking

          spend_limit: Amount (in cents) to limit approved authorizations. Transaction requests above
              the spend limit will be declined. Note that a spend limit of 0 is effectively no
              limit, and should only be used to reset or remove a prior limit. Only a limit of
              1 or above will result in declined transactions due to checks against the card
              limit.

          spend_limit_duration:
              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorize multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.

              limit, and should only be used to reset or remove a prior limit. Only a limit of
              1 or above will result in declined transactions due to checks against the card
              limit.

              Spend limit duration values:

              - `ANNUALLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit in a calendar
                year.
              - `FOREVER` - Card will authorize only up to spend limit for the entire lifetime
                of the card.
              - `MONTHLY` - Card will authorize transactions up to spend limit for the
                trailing month. Month is calculated as this calendar date one month prior.
              - `TRANSACTION` - Card will authorize multiple transactions if each individual
                transaction is under the spend limit.

          state:
              Card state values:

              - `CLOSED` - Card will no longer approve authorizations. Closing a card cannot
                be undone.
              - `OPEN` - Card will approve authorizations (if they match card and account
                parameters).
              - `PAUSED` - Card will decline authorizations, but can be resumed at a later
                time.

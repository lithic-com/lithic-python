              values:

              - `SUSPECTED_FRAUD`: The transaction is suspected to be fraudulent, but this

                `SUSPECTED_FRAUD` state.

                this state from the `SUSPECTED_FRAUD` state.

          comment: Optional field providing additional information or context about why the
              transaction is considered fraudulent.

          fraud_type: Specifies the type or category of fraud that the transaction is suspected or
              confirmed to involve, string (enum) supporting the following values:

              - `FIRST_PARTY_FRAUD`: First-party fraud occurs when a legitimate account or
                cardholder intentionally misuses financial services for personal gain. This
                includes actions such as disputing legitimate transactions to obtain a refund,
                abusing return policies, or defaulting on credit obligations without intent to
                repay.
              - `ACCOUNT_TAKEOVER`: Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
                unauthorized access to an existing account, modifies account settings, and
                carries out fraudulent transactions.
              - `CARD_COMPROMISED`: Card compromised fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
                access to card details without taking over the account, such as through
                physical card theft, cloning, or online data breaches.
              - `IDENTITY_THEFT`: Identity theft fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen
                personal information, such as Social Security numbers or addresses, to open
                accounts, apply for loans, or conduct financial transactions in someone's
                name.
              - `CARDHOLDER_MANIPULATION`: This type of fraud occurs when a fraudster
                manipulates or coerces a legitimate cardholder into unauthorized transactions,
                often through social engineering tactics.

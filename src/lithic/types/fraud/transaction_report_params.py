    Specifies the type or category of fraud that the transaction is suspected or
    confirmed to involve, string (enum) supporting the following values:

    - `FIRST_PARTY_FRAUD`: First-party fraud occurs when a legitimate account or
      cardholder intentionally misuses financial services for personal gain. This
      includes actions such as disputing legitimate transactions to obtain a refund,
      abusing return policies, or defaulting on credit obligations without intent to
      repay.
    - `ACCOUNT_TAKEOVER`: Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
      unauthorized access to an existing account, modifies account settings, and
      carries out fraudulent transactions.
    - `CARD_COMPROMISED`: Card compromised fraud occurs when a fraudster gains
      access to card details without taking over the account, such as through
      physical card theft, cloning, or online data breaches.
    - `IDENTITY_THEFT`: Identity theft fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen
      personal information, such as Social Security numbers or addresses, to open
      accounts, apply for loans, or conduct financial transactions in someone's
      name.
    - `CARDHOLDER_MANIPULATION`: This type of fraud occurs when a fraudster
      manipulates or coerces a legitimate cardholder into unauthorized transactions,
      often through social engineering tactics.

    """The attribute to target.

    The following attributes may be targeted:

    - `MCC`: A four-digit number listed in ISO 18245. An MCC is used to classify a
      business by the types of goods or services it provides.
    - `COUNTRY`: Country of entity of card acceptor. Possible values are: (1) all
      ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes, (2) QZZ for Kosovo, and (3) ANT for
      Netherlands Antilles.
    - `CURRENCY`: 3-character alphabetic ISO 4217 code for the merchant currency of
      the transaction.
    - `MERCHANT_ID`: Unique alphanumeric identifier for the payment card acceptor
      (merchant).
    - `DESCRIPTOR`: Short description of card acceptor.
    - `LIABILITY_SHIFT`: Indicates whether chargeback liability shift to the issuer
      applies to the transaction. Valid values are `NONE`, `3DS_AUTHENTICATED`, or
      `TOKEN_AUTHENTICATED`.
    - `PAN_ENTRY_MODE`: The method by which the cardholder's primary account number
      (PAN) was entered. Valid values are `AUTO_ENTRY`, `BAR_CODE`, `CONTACTLESS`,

      `MAGNETIC_STRIPE`, `MANUAL`, `OCR`, `SECURE_CARDLESS`, `UNSPECIFIED`,
      `UNKNOWN`, `CREDENTIAL_ON_FILE`, or `ECOMMERCE`.
    - `TRANSACTION_AMOUNT`: The base transaction amount (in cents) plus the acquirer

      the issuer should authorize against unless the issuer is paying the acquirer
      fee on behalf of the cardholder.
    - `RISK_SCORE`: Network-provided score assessing risk level associated with a
      given authorization. Scores are on a range of 0-999, with 0 representing the
      lowest risk and 999 representing the highest risk. For Visa transactions,
      where the raw score has a range of 0-99, Lithic will normalize the score by
      multiplying the raw score by 10x.
    - `CARD_TRANSACTION_COUNT_1H`: The number of transactions on the card in the
      trailing hour up and until the authorization.
